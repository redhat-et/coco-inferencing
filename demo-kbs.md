# KBS Attestation Demo Guide - Production Configuration

This guide demonstrates the Key Broker Service (KBS) integration with production-ready certificates and configurable attestation policies for encrypted model inference.

## Overview

The KBS demo replaces the manual `kubectl cp` method with automatic attestation-based key retrieval. The setup includes:

- **Production KBS**: HTTPS-enabled with Ed25519 auth keys and TLS certificates
- **Mock Attestation Service**: Simulates TEE attestation with configurable allow/deny policies
- **Enhanced Init Container**: Uses HTTPS KBS client instead of waiting for manual key transfer
- **Automated Workflow**: Complete make targets for end-to-end demo deployment

## Quick Start - Automated Demo

### Complete ALLOW Scenario (One Command)
```bash
# Deploy production KBS + run successful attestation demo
make demo-kbs-allow

# Monitor the workflow
kubectl logs encrypted-model-inference -c model-downloader -f
```

### Complete DENY Scenario (One Command)
```bash
# Deploy production KBS + run failed attestation demo
make demo-kbs-deny

# Monitor the workflow
kubectl logs encrypted-model-inference -c model-downloader -f
```

### Reset Environment
```bash
# Clean up everything and reset
make demo-reset
```

## Manual Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Attestation (ALLOW)
```bash
# Set policy to allow access
make kbs-policy-allow

# Deploy pod - will succeed in getting the key
make deploy-encrypted-pod-kind
```

### Scenario 2: Failed Attestation (DENY) 
```bash
# Set policy to deny access
make kbs-policy-deny

# Deploy pod - will fail to get the key
make deploy-encrypted-pod-kind
```

## Complete Demo Workflow

### 1. Setup Production Infrastructure

**Quick Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
# Start kind cluster and registry
make kind

# Deploy production KBS with certificates and authentication
make deploy-kbs-production
```

**Manual Step-by-Step Setup:**
```bash
# Start kind cluster and registry
make kind

# Generate secure certificates (Ed25519 auth + RSA TLS)
make gen-kbs-certs

# Create Kubernetes secrets for certificates
make setup-kbs-secrets

# Deploy KBS infrastructure
make deploy-kbs

# Populate KBS with private key
make populate-kbs-secrets

# Wait for KBS services to be ready
make wait-for-kbs

# Build and push updated downloader container
make build-push-downloader
```

### 2. Demo: Successful Access
```bash
# Configure policy to allow access (default)
make kbs-policy-allow

# Deploy the inference pod (for Kind cluster)
make deploy-encrypted-pod-kind

# Monitor the logs - should see successful attestation
kubectl logs encrypted-model-inference -c model-downloader -f

# Expected output:
# üîê KBS-based Private Key Retrieval
# ‚úÖ Services are ready!
# üîç Requesting attestation...
# ‚úÖ Attestation successful!
# üîë Requesting secret: private.key
# ‚úÖ Secret retrieved successfully!
# ‚úÖ Private key saved to /shared/keys/private.key
```

### 3. Demo: Access Denied
```bash
# Delete previous pod
kubectl delete pod encrypted-model-inference

# Configure policy to deny access
make kbs-policy-deny

# Deploy the inference pod again (for Kind cluster)
make deploy-encrypted-pod-kind

# Monitor the logs - should see failed attestation
kubectl logs encrypted-model-inference -c model-downloader -f

# Expected output:
# üîê KBS-based Private Key Retrieval
# ‚úÖ Services are ready!
# üîç Requesting attestation...
# ‚ùå Attestation failed!
#    Reason: Invalid TEE measurement
# üí• Key retrieval failed!
```

### 4. Policy Management
```bash
# Check current policy
make kbs-status

# Switch between policies
make kbs-policy-allow   # Enable access
make kbs-policy-deny    # Disable access

# View attestation service logs
kubectl logs deployment/mock-attestation-service
```

## Key Components

### Mock Attestation Service
- **Policy Configuration**: JSON-based policy switching
- **Simulation**: Generates realistic TEE evidence
- **Logging**: Clear allow/deny decisions with reasons

### KBS Client (Python)
- **Attestation Flow**: Simulates TEE evidence generation
- **Secret Retrieval**: Retrieves private key from KBS
- **Error Handling**: Clear failure messages for debugging

### Enhanced Init Container
- **Automatic Retrieval**: No manual key transfer needed
- **Attestation Integration**: Uses KBS client for key access
- **Fallback Logging**: Detailed error reporting

## Customization for Vendor Integration

The mock attestation service can be easily replaced with a real vendor solution:

1. **Replace Mock AS**: Update `mock-attestation-service.yaml` with real AS endpoint
2. **Update Evidence Generation**: Modify `kbs-client.py` to use real TEE evidence
3. **Configure Policies**: Update KBS policies for production requirements

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check all components
make kbs-status

# View logs
kubectl logs deployment/kbs
kubectl logs deployment/mock-attestation-service
kubectl logs encrypted-model-inference -c model-downloader

# Reset demo
make delete-kbs
make deploy-kbs
make populate-kbs-secrets
```

## Production Features
