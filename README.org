* Confidential Inferencing

Experimenting with encrypted model delivery into a confidential inferencing environment.

** Approach

Use an init container to copy the model image from a registry into ramdisk inside the
confidential container.

** Steps

1. Run ~make kind~ to start a kind cluster
2. Run ~make init-container~ to build the init-container image
3. Run ~make run~ to run the inference pod

** Usage

#+begin_src sh
% make
kind                 Start a kind cluster
init-container       Build the init container
run                  Run the inferencing pod
clean                Clean everything up, also deleting the kind cluster
